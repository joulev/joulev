I am a software developer. I build things for the web, mostly using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Sometimes I also [contribute to Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commits?author=joulev) itself, especially when I get bitten hard by a bug in the framework (which has happened more occasionally than I'd like it to).

I also was a frequent community helper in the [official Next.js Discord server](https://nextjs.org/discord). You can find me around the top of the [forum leaderboard](https://nextjs-forum.com). Though it is *was*, not *am* — due to personal reasons, I no longer do that.

In free time, I usually either work on side projects or learn about new stuff related to web development. Or just randomly walk around in a quiet park, because Singapore has a lot of them and I find them very peaceful. Or watch [a *lot* of anime](https://joulev.dev/apps/anime).

I almost always listen to music whenever I can. My taste ranges from beautiful classical masterpieces or movie soundtracks to catchy Japanese popular music. Combinations of the two, like pieces by [Yuki Kajiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Kajiura), are simply perfection ✨
