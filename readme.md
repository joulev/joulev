I am a software developer. I build things for the web, mostly using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

In free time, I usually either work on side projects or learn about new stuff related to web development. Or just randomly walk around in a quiet park, because Singapore has a lot of them and I find them very peaceful.

I almost always listen to music whenever I can. My taste ranges from beautiful classical masterpieces or movie soundtracks to catchy Japanese popular music.

I used to be a helper and moderator on [the official Next.js Discord server](https://nextjs.org/discord).
